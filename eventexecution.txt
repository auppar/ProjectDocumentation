The analysis represents the program as a flowgraph in which each node contains an instruction and each edge represents potential control flow between the instructions in the program. The graph has a designated program entry node.

there are 3 kinds of edges
Ordinary edges - edges for intra procedural control flow.
Exception edges - reaches a catch node from a node which raises an exception.
call and return edges -




Process to organise the events:
->	During the process the 
->	Firstly we have an addeventlistener node type in the flow graph.
->	

How are the set of all event handlers organised into a single control flow graph?
->	All the event handler objects for different types of event handlers are captured in seperate lists in a outer list called "MaySets".	


How is the abstract interpretation performed on this graph?

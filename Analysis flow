Class Hierarchy used to build the DOM tree in the browser:

The objects of the leaf nodes of the hierarchy are instantiated when a runtime dom tree is created. The hierarchy in the 
dom tree is maintained as per the tag-containment in the HTML page for the application.
    
     |-> Document -> HTMLDocument
     |
     |                              |-> HTMLHeadElement 
Node |-> Element  -> HTMLElement -> |-> HTMLParagraphElement
     |                              |-> HTMLInputElement
     |

     |-> CharacterData ->|

Steps towards analysis of HTML application using TAJS:
 
  As a part of initial state to the data flow analysis the abstract objects of different dom modules are built
    - DOM Core
    - DOM HTML - runtime HTML objects are modeled with the name "HTML[tagtype]ELEMENT".
    - DOM Event
    - Window Object
